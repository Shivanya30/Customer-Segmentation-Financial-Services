## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of customer segmentation for a financial services company's credit card customers. By employing demographic, behavioral, and combined segmentation approaches, we aim to identify distinct customer groups, understand their characteristics, and derive insights that can drive targeted marketing strategies and improve customer retention.



## Key Components
- **Demographic-Based Segmentation**: Clusters customers based on age, income, education level, etc.
- **Behavioral-Based Segmentation**: Clusters based on spending patterns, card usage frequency, etc.
- **Cross-Cluster Analysis**: A comparative analysis of the demographic and behavioral segments.
- **Combined Segmentation**: Integrates both demographic and behavioral attributes for deeper insights.
