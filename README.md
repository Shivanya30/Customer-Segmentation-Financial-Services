# Customer Segmentation for Financial Services Company

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of customer segmentation for a financial services company's credit card customers. By employing demographic, behavioral, and combined segmentation approaches, we aim to identify distinct customer groups, understand their characteristics, and derive insights that can drive targeted marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

## Key Components
- **Demographic-Based Segmentation**: Clusters customers based on age, income, education level, etc.
- **Behavioral-Based Segmentation**: Clusters based on spending patterns, card usage frequency, etc.
- **Cross-Cluster Analysis**: A comparative analysis of the demographic and behavioral segments.
- **Combined Segmentation**: Integrates both demographic and behavioral attributes for deeper insights.

## Datasets
- Customer demographic data (e.g., age, income, education).
- Transactional data (e.g., spending amounts, categories, frequency of credit card usage).

## Technologies Used
- **Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn)**: For data processing, clustering (K-means), and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- **Power BI**: To create dashboards for customer segmentation insights.

## Key Insights
- Identification of customer groups based on both demographics and behaviors.
- Insights into spending patterns across different customer segments.
- Recommendations for targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.
